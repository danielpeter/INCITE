Goals
-----

The main goal of our proposed research is to image Earth's global interior based on full waveform inversions in unprecedented resolution. By fully taking into account Earth's anelasticity and anisotropy, we aim to assimilate all available data from more than 6,000 earthquakes, facilitating a deeper understanding of Earth's internal physical processes and mineral physics.

Building on our research experiences and advances on Titan,
our goals for the requested allocation are: (i) higher resolution simulations, reducing the shortest period to 17 s and increasing the record length to 200 min, therefore combining higher frequency body waves with major-arc surfaces waves which provide better sampling, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and beneath the Pacific Plate; (ii) exploit and further develop ASDF to grow the earthquake database; (iii) incorporate azimuthal anisotropy, which is essential for understanding lithospheric and mantle dynamics; and (iv) as the elastic structure improves, move towards full waveform inversion by also incorporating amplitude information and simultaneously inverting for elastic and anelastic heterogeneity, thereby placing constraints on, e.g., water content in the crust and mantle.


Our ultimate goal is to assimilate seismic data from more than 6,000 earthquakes within the magnitude range 5.5 <= M_w <= 7.0, which have been recorded by global seismographic networks and numerous temporary seismic arrays.
To take full advantage of this data set on ORNL's computational resources,
we need a solid framework for managing big data sets during pre-processing (e.g., data requests and quality checks), gradient calculations, and post-processing (e.g., pre-conditioning and smoothing gradients).
Addressing these challenges has led to productive collaborations with ORNL staff on all aspects of the adjoint tomography workflow, specifically with Judith Hill on code optimization and workflow management tools, with Norbert Podhorski on I/O issues and data formats, and with Dave Pugmire on visualization and virtualization. We look forward to further expanding and capitalizing on these exciting interactions.
